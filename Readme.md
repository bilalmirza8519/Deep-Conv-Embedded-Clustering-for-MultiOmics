Keras code for clusteing temporal trends of proteins and metabolites based on visual similarity. This code has been modified from the DCEC algorithm. Please cite the following papers.

Original DCEC code is available at https://github.com/XifengGuo/DCEC from publication "Xifeng Guo, Xinwang Liu, En Zhu, Jianping Yin. Deep Clustering with Convolutional Autoencoders. ICONIP 2017"

Description on the  clustering of protein and metabolited using DCEC ca ne found in the following paper
